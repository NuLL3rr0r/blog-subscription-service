Blog Subscription Service
=========================

A multilingual blog subscription service written in C++ on top of Wt webtoolkit with high performance in mind.

I developed this subscription service based on my own requirements, for my [English](http://www.babaei.net) and [Farsi](http://fa.babaei.net) blogs. It should work elsewhere on other websites or blogs out of the box, without any hassle.
